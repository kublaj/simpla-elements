# Simpla Elements Catalogue
[![Published][webcomponents-badge]][webcomponents-collection] [![Simpla slack group][slack-badge]][slack-url]

This is an open catalogue of elements built on the [Simpla](https://www.simpla.io) content system. The catalogue is hosted on [simpla.io/elements][elements-catalogue] and [webcomponents.org][webcomponents-collection].

## Creating a Simpla element

It's easy to build your own custom Simpla elements, [read the guide](https://www.simpla.io/docs/creating-simpla-elements) on simpla.io for more.

## Publishing your element

Publishing an element to the Simpla catalogue is as easy as following a few steps:

1. Ensure your element has a README and follows the `simpla-` naming convention
2. Fork this repo
2. Add your element as a dependency to `bower.json`
3. [Submit a Pull Request](https://github.com/simplaio/elements/compare) to this repo
4. [Publish](https://www.webcomponents.org/publish) your element to webcomponents.org to create the element page that simpla.io will link to

Once the PR is merged your element should be available in the catalogues on both [simpla.io/elements][elements-catalogue] and [webcomponents.org][webcomponents-collection]
